## **eBPF Steering Committee (BSC)**

The eBPF Foundation eBPF Steering Committee (BSC) is the technical and collaborative governing body of the eBPF community as defined in the Foundation [charter](https://ebpf.foundation/charter/). Our mission is to advance the development, adoption, and best practices of eBPF technology through consensus-driven, community-led initiatives. We are responsible for:

* **Defining and maintaining the technical vision** for the eBPF ecosystem, ensuring it aligns with industry needs and innovations.
* **Creating a cohesive architecture** for eBPF, ensuring alignment between tools,libraries, and projects, and fostering integration across various use cases.
* **Collecting and acting on feedback** from users, contributors, and industry leaders and using it to inform the evolution of eBPF and community standards.
* **Standardizing interfaces** between components, where necessary, by aligning on best practices and implementations.
* **Encouraging and promoting common practices** across the eBPF ecosystem to ensure consistency, reliability, and ease of adoption.
* **Identifying areas of collaboration** with adjacent open source communities (e.g., kernel, compiler, and debugger communities) to encourage the widespread adoption and integration of eBPF technology.
* **Proposing priorities** to the Governing Board for events, travel funds, and other investments that will foster growth in the eBPF developer and user communities.

By facilitating collaboration and transparency, the eBPF Foundation BSC strives to guide the long-term success of eBPF for all.

## **BSC Technical Vision**

The technical direction of the ecosystem is problem-centric. We encourage and support eBPF to solve problems faced by adopters, to build the right ecosystem for innovation, and embrace changes in the broader technical landscape. To exercise and increase the expertise within the technical community to compose solutions that stand the test of time.

## **Membership and Voting**

Any BSC member and/or the Governing Board can propose a new member to be added to the BSC. To accept a new member, two-thirds of the entire BSC must approve. Any member of the BSC may be removed by a two-thirds majority of the other BSC members.

Ideally, decisions are made by consensus, but if a vote is needed, each member gets one vote, and most decisions are made by a simple majority. For BSC meetings, at least 60% of voting members must be present to make decisions. If not enough members are present, the meeting can continue but no decisions can be made.

## **Meeting Time and Minutes**

The BSC meets roughly every two weeks and all meeting minutes can be found in the Github repo.
