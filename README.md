## **eBPF Steering Committee (BSC)**

The eBPF Foundation eBPF Steering Committee (BSC) is the technical and collaborative governing body of the eBPF community as defined in the Foundation [charter](https://ebpf.foundation/charter/). Our mission is to advance the development, adoption, and best practices of eBPF technology through consensus-driven, community-led initiatives. We are responsible for:

* **Defining and maintaining the technical vision** for the eBPF ecosystem, ensuring it aligns with industry needs and innovations.
* **Coordinating collaboration** for eBPF, ensuring alignment between tools, libraries, and projects, and fostering integration across various use cases.
* **Coordinating and evangelizing eBPF** projects and technologies to current and potential developers and users.
* **Identifying areas of collaboration** with adjacent open source communities (e.g., kernel, compiler, and debugger communities) to encourage the widespread adoption and integration of eBPF technology.
* **Proposing priorities** to the Governing Board for community developmen actives, events, travel funds, and other investments that will foster growth in the eBPF developer and user communities.

By facilitating collaboration and transparency, the eBPF Foundation BSC strives to guide the long-term success of eBPF for all.

## **BSC Technical Vision**

## **Membership and Voting**

Any BSC member and/or the Governing Board can propose a new member to be added to the BSC. To accept a new member, two-thirds of the entire BSC must approve. Any member of the BSC may be removed by a two-thirds majority of the other BSC members.

Ideally, decisions are made by consensus, but if a vote is needed, each member gets one vote, and most decisions are made by a simple majority. For BSC meetings, at least 60% of voting members must be present to make decisions. If not enough members are present, the meeting can continue but no decisions can be made.

## **Meeting Time and Minutes**

The BSC meets roughly every two weeks and all meeting minutes can be found in the Github repo.
